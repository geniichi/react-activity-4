                    I have told her that hers will go far.
                    'Oh, it's really not cool
                    driving this crap to school.'
                    'Do I need that emotional scar? '
                </p>
                <p>
                    'The kids will all laugh at the rust.
                    When we race, I'll be left in the dust!
                    I will save up some cash
                    then we'll make a mad dash
                    to the car dealer surely you trust'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    'He will make us a wonderful deal
                    and I'm sure you will know how I feel.
                    I will love you so much,
                    My siblings... I won't touch.
                    Just get me behind a new wheel'!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now she'll be cruisin in style.
                    She'll be happy for only awhile.
                    There will always be better
                    and we'll try hard to get her
                    a car that will make princess smile."
